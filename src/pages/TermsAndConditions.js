                            without notice or liability. This version of the Terms became effective on the date set
                            forth above and this version amends the version effective before such date. We reserve the
                            right, in our sole discretion, to amend these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time.
                            Notification of any amendment will be posted on the Site by the indication of the last
                            amendment date at the top of these Terms and will be effective immediately. When members
                            renew subscriptions, the terms in effect at the time of renewal will govern, provided that
                            such terms may change as described above.</p>
                        <p className="para my-3">We also reserve the right, in our sole discretion and from time to time, to
                            offer programs, products or services with unique terms and conditions that are separate from
                            and may supersede or supplement in certain respects these Terms. In such cases, your use of
                            the Site with respect to such special program is governed by these Terms together with the
                            terms and conditions of such program, product or service. We reserve the right, but assume
                            no obligation, to agree to different or conflicting terms and conditions with respect to any
                            user. Any such terms and conditions will not be enforceable unless specifically agreed to by
                            us.</p>
                        <p className="para my-3">We do not separately file the Terms entered into by each user of the Site.
                            Please make a copy of these Terms for your records by printing and/or saving a downloaded
                            copy of the Terms on your personal computer. We may immediately terminate any user’s access
                            to or use of the Site due to such user’s breach of these Terms or any other unauthorized use
                            of the Site. However, we do not guarantee that we will take action against all breaches of
                            these Terms. Our failure to take immediate action with respect to a breach by you or others
                            does not waive our right to act with respect to such breach or any other breach.</p>
                        <p className="para my-3">These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us and you with respect
                            to the matters set forth herein, and supersede any prior agreement between us and you with
                            respect to your use of the Site. Headings in these Terms are for reference only and do not
                            limit the scope or extent of such section. In the event of any conflict between these Terms
                            and any other terms and conditions applicable to a product, tool or service offered on our
                            Site, the Terms herein shall prevail. If any portion of these Terms is found to be invalid
                            or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of these Terms
                            shall remain in full force and effect. Further, any provision of these Terms held invalid or
                            unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in full force and effect to the extent not
                            held invalid or unenforceable.</p>
