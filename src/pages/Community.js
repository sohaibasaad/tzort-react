                                    was able to provide for my family during those hard times
                                    and now that we are no longer facing such hardship I even am able to provide gifts to them,

                                <p className="para my-3">Hello, my name is Rainbow. I live in the Philippines and I am an
                                    undergraduate. I have not seen any of my parents since, as they died early. I was raised by
                                    my grandparents, and I could say that they were the best grandparents. They taught me all I
                                    needed to know about life. How to perceive and strive as life is hard, to respect people and
                                    be thankful for everything that is given. I have had worked in the BPO industry for more
                                    than 10 years. It made my life better, I earned enough just to get by with my daily life.
                                </p>
                                <p className="para my-3">Now that I’m married with three little ones, everything has changed. We all
                                    know how important these responsibilities are, and we make every effort to ensure that they
                                    are in good condition. Having said that, my wife and I haven’t had anything for ourselves
                                    because all of my salary goes straight to the necessities and sometimes it is just not
                                    enough. </p>
                                <p className="para my-3">One day, my sister-in-law asked for a favor and wanted me to help her get a
                                    job,
                                    and so I did. I referred her to a friend whose post I saw on Facebook looking for an
                                    employee. I went with her to take the interview, and there I talked to Charmaine. We talked
                                    about how life had been challenging. I even told her about my plans to go abroad and work as
                                    a factory worker and all that. Suddenly, she offered me the job instead of my sister-in-law.
                                    I was hesitant at first, but given the timing, it was somewhat like an opportunity knocking
                                    at my doorstep. I decided to grab it and let go of the comfort that I had gotten used to
                                    working in a call center. Currently, I’m simply thankful. There are no words to express how
                                    much the company has helped me and continues to improve our way of living. Once again, thank
                                    you.</p>

                                    the Covid – 19 crisis. One of those who was greatly affected is my own family. My mother
                                    needed to resign from work due to health reasons & it was a unanimous decision as well since
                                    we wanted her to stay at home since she is high-risk of getting infected.</p>

                                    since he works in the restaurant field as many establishments were closed. My older sister

                                    international lockdowns. It was a battle both financially & emotionally. It was when I
                                    desperately wanted to step up & help my family get through this dilemma. I was hoping for a
                                    miracle and searching for a stable job so I can help them. Fortunately, a good friend of

                                    to Cebu to me anytime since our hometown is Ormoc but it is better than her working in
                                    Taiwan anyway its just an hour trip from Ormoc to Cebu. we are good as complete and I’m very

                                    that would make our lives easier. I was able to build a comfortable house for my family and
                                    my daughters and was able to help others in need. You guys have changed our lives, you made
                                    it way better. Let me share with you a bit of my story.</p>
                                <p className="para my-3">When I was young, I and my siblings would go to our neighbors’ just so we
                                    could watch TV and most of the time, we had windows and doors closed right before us. I went
                                    to school with nothing but the determination to finish my studies. Walked to and from every
                                    school day with fruits in my bag to bargain for a piece of paper I could use for the day.
                                    Whenever it rains, we’ll just use banana leaves for us to at least keep our bags dry until
                                    we get to school. Things get worst when I got pregnant with my first baby. My parents
                                    expected me as the eldest to step up and help but I failed them. However, I did not give up.
                                    I used these to gain the courage to get out of my comfort zone and that’s what leads me to
                                    you guys. </p>
                                <p className="para my-3">Everything has changed since then. We now have our own TV. We now have
                                    motorcycles which my siblings could use when they go to school and we can now buy any food
                                    we want to eat, we now have cakes on our birthdays and an umbrella. That’s why I am forever
                                    grateful to you.</p>

                                    company. This company helped my family a lot, especially those times when I need them the
                                    most. I would like to share a very sad life event that happened to my life last year way
                                    back in December. When Cebu was hit by typhoon Odette our house was destroyed and it was one
                                    of the darkest days of my life. everything was so hard that time. Food became so expensive,
                                    drinkable water prices went up, no electricity. I was so afraid that I don’t know what to
                                    do.</p>
                                <p className="para my-3">That was the time when I asked god for guidance to guide me. Everybody was
                                    so busy looking for a way to get food for their family that helping was not an option.</p>
                                <p className="para my-3">I was on the brink of giving up until I saw the light, from a very special
                                    person. It was Cham, Cham didn’t hesitate to help me at all. Thanks to her and the company I
                                    was able to bring food to my family I even had a chance to help a lot of my friends who also
                                    needed help. I am very thankful that I became a member of this company it’s the best thing
                                    that happened in my life. I hope this company will continue to grow and also the people
                                    around me this is the best achievement that happen in my life.A very big thank you from the

                                    working with everyone it does not feel that I’m working, I sometimes can’t keep track of the

                                    after she was gone I have been given the opportunity to work with your company and I felt
                                    that this is her way in taking care of us since I am a single mom and she has always been so
                                    supportive of me financially and always worrying what will happen to us when she is gone.
                                    Now, I am more than grateful with all the blessings that I received from my work. I can now
                                    fully support my children who are in college, pay for our groceries, provide pocket money
                                    when they go out and most of all save money. I am seeing a bright future with the company,
