After the Jamestown Colony either the same day or the following day whatever works out for your schedule, you can then go to Colonial Williamsburg end see part of the founding City in the capital itself well, in the area also make time to go to Yorktown to see where the Revolutionary War was won, see the local battlefields visit the museums and learn much more first-hand about those amazing Americans that helped win our independence from England."),n.a.createElement("p",{className:"para my-3"},"I grew up in the area living most of my childhood in Yorktown Virginia how many times a year I would go down to the battlefields just to walk the battlefields or go down to the very nearby Yorktown Beach and actually play and have fun on the beach? but the museums in the area are some of the best in the world and they\u2019re actually cited in historic locations. so when you\u2019re studying and learning about the Revolutionary War, you\u2019re doing so on the actual grounds on which several of the battles were fought.

Then, of course, you have the Cobblestone Road through Colonial Williamsburg and all the shops and all the historic landmarks that you can visit all right there in one location.

But in Jamestown, you also get access to some really well-done coverage of the lives of the local Indians, and of course, it goes into a lot of the comment historic themes of how the local Indians including Pocahontas and James Smith interacted during those early foundational Days of our nation. Then once I Twilight Jamestown you can also learn how the Indians made Dugout canoes as well as see a ship Builder actually building local boats from local wood sources that were the same type of building methods used for the ships that brought over the settlers for the Jamestown Settlement itself.

It makes the park really special and unique because of how it\u2019s themed and how all the rides and entertainment and food follow that pattern and it makes for a very fun layout for a park. having grown up in the area, I\u2019ve had the pleasure of going to Busch Gardens probably over a hundred times in my lifetime.

If you remember your party does you not want to walk a great deal but you are mobile enough, you can also use the Skylift which will take you from one section of a park to the other and you could get on the first Sky Lift or chairlift right after you enter the park if you enter the park you\u2019ll see that you come into the country of England and if you go off to the right to head out of the park and start walking on the walkway on your left is one of the first Sky lives or chair lifts and that cheerless will take you all the way across the park to France from where you are in England."),n.a.createElement("p",{className:"para my-3"},"if you\u2019re okay with walking though you can walk the circumference of this park probably in an hour or less as long as you\u2019re okay with those walking points where you got kind of steep inclines or declines. just like any other Circle you can go either direction you like most people go to the right and go on the natural course around that Circle but you could go in the opposite direction as well and sometimes it\u2019s a good choice if the park is particularly busy that day."),n.a.createElement("p",{className:"para my-3"},"add Busch Gardens.

Here you will find many draft beers as well as German meals in German desserts. the fast house itself is a giant-scale dining and entertainment venue where you can come in and sit at very large picnic-style tables together in an air-conditioned building around the central building there is a stage where live music and bands play."),n.a.createElement("p",{className:"para my-3"},"just outside of the Fest house itself you will find local carnival games which are always fun for the kids to play or for the dad to try to win the kid\u2019s surprises but just going to plan your trip here strategically because you don\u2019t want to win a large prize and then have to carry it around for the second half of your day. so if you come to the Fest house to eat for lunch or for an early dinner and the kids see the games let them know that you\u2019ll come back to the games and you\u2019ll play in a little while and you can take them right around the corner from the games and the right bumper cars and ride some other smaller rides and that works as a great discredit distraction from those carnival games for the kids for a while."),n.a.createElement("p",{className:"para my-3"},"Not far from Germany in the Gasthaus area, you can go over to Italy Italy has more small rides and they also have a large water ride and a very large coaster. the coaster that you\u2019re fine here though is not for the faint of heart it\u2019s called Apollo\u2019s Chariot and it has quite a drop if you go into Little Italy from the main part of Italy you can actually go close to one of the water rides and look at the drop-in watch people ride that coaster over that Giant Drop.
